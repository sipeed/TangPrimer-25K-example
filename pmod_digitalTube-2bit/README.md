## -Buttons/LED/Digital Tube PMOD Example

### Operation Flow

+ Assemble

  ![](shape.jpg)

On the three PMOD interfaces, plug the key switch module, LED module, and digital tube module in order.

+ Open (pmod_digitalTube-2bit.gprj) using the GoWin SDK
+ Execute the Synthesize and  Place & Route，then write the bitstream to Tang Primer 25K by Program Device.It is also possible to directly write to a pregenerated bitstream file using Program Device（pmod_digitalTube-2bit\impl\pnr\pmod_digitalTube-2bit.fs）
+ The upper right corner  of Tang Primer 25K is the reset button, which is external pull-up. Therefore, if it is used as the reset button, the internal weak pull-down is needed when the pin constraint is used
+ Digital Tube and buttons
  + The digital tube is displayed in decimal mode, and the initial value is 0.
  + Press the first button to add 1 to the digital tube;
  + Press the second button to add 2 to the digital tube;
  + Press the  third button to add 4 to the digital tube;
  + Press the fourth button to add 8 to the digital tube;
+ LED array and dip switch
  + The dip switch is represented in binary mode and mapped to the LED indicator. If the binary representation of the dip switch is 3, the third LED lights up.
  + The highest bit of the dip switch is HIGH, then the LED flow lamp.
### Tips
+ If you need the replication project, right-click Configuration in Synthesize and set the top-level module.

+ I/O multiplexing needs to be set with the Dual-Purpose Pin of Place & Route in the interface.
